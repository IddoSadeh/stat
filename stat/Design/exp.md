# Experimental Design and the Analysis of Variance

## Introduction

- Experiments are a key type of statistical study.
- In experiments, data items are termed experimental units or subjects (when humans).
- These units/subjects are randomly assigned to different experimental conditions.
- The measurement obtained from each unit is termed the response.
- The simplest experiments have an identified explanatory variable called a factor.
- This factor can be changed to set the experimental conditions.
- Experimental units are assigned to different levels of the factor.
- The researcher measures the response variable for each unit.
- The values of the response under different factor levels are compared to identify any apparent effect.

**Example** 

In what was perhaps the first clinical trial, during 1747 Scottish doctor James Lind studied the effect of citrus fruits on scurvy, a condition known now to be caused by a lack of vitamin C. Taking as subjects twelve sailors who had developed scurvy two months into a sea voyage, Lind split the subjects into six groups of two, and administered a different dietary supplement to each pair. Today, most of the treatments applied look odd (one group received half a pint of seawater, for example), but after five days the pair receiving two oranges and a lemon had nearly recovered from their scurvy. Only the subjects in one other group showed any improvement.

Due to the experimental units being randomly assigned to treatments, via an experiment we may hope to establish a cause and effect relationship between the response variable and a factor. Such a relationship can never be inferred from an observational study, since there may be confounding variables. However, when investigating certain hypotheses conducting an experiment is either impractical or unethical. For instance, the possible effects on health of living close to overhead power cables is not possible to study via an experiment.

We summarise the key principles of a designed experiment:

1. **Control:** As much as is possible, conditions for all experimental units are kept the same apart from changes to the factor. In the example above, Lind ensured that the living conditions and diets of all his subjects were the same during his study on scurvy, so that as much as possible variation in the health of the sailors could be attributed to the supplement.
2. **Randomization:** Experimental units must be assigned to treatments at random. Only then can the possible effects of any hidden or confounding variables be eliminated.
3. **Replication:** The only way to assess whether variability in the response variable is due to the treatments applied is to have more than one subject in each treatment group. With such replication we can estimate the variability within each group, and compare it to the variation between each group. As will be seen, the methods used to study experiments do not work unless there is more than one experimental unit given each treatment. A second form of replication is when entire studies are repeated to attempt to validate the results of an earlier study. For example, Bem's work on "feeling the future" (see the activity on power) could lead to attempts by researchers to replicate the findings. Such verification is an important step in scientific research.
4. **Blocking:** There may be attributes of the experimental units that cannot be controlled but which nevertheless may affect the response variable. For example, suppose a type of cancer progresses differently in men and women. To test the effectiveness of three treatments, we could obtain thirty men and thirty women, and randomly assign the sixty subjects to the three treatments without regard for gender. Suppose the response is two-year survival rate. In doing the experiment as described it could be that one treatment is applied to mostly women. Given that gender is known to be associated with survival times for this cancer, it would be preferable for the men and women to be separated and randomly assigned a treatment within each gender "block". In this way we could be sure that ten men and ten women receive each treatment, with gender being the blocking variable. Appreciate in this example that blocking is not essential, but could greatly improve the efficiency of the experiment.
