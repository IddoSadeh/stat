## IUPAC rules

1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms. This chain determines the parent
name (root) of the alkane. The parent suffix for akanes is -ane.
2. Number the chain beginning at the end of the chain nearest any branching, thus
obtaining the use of lower numbers in the name.
3. Use these numbers to designate the location of the substituents groups. Substitutent
alkyl groups are referred to with suffix “-yl” (i.e., an alkane substitutent is an alkyl)
4. If two or more substituents are present on the same carbon atom, use the number
twice.
5. If an alkyl group appears more than once, use the prefixes: di, tri, tetra, penta, hexa,
etc.
6. List the groups alphabetically (root group is used from rule 3, not the prefixes from 5).
7. Numbers are separated from letters by dash (-). Multiple numbers are separated by
commas (,).
