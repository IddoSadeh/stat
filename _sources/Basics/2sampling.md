# Sampling
When a statistical study is down on a population, this is called taking a *census*. Many times this is infeasable, and only a *sample* is studied.

## Variance
Unlike the previous chapter, the variance for a sample is calculated differntly. It is sometimes called the quantity or the adjusted variance:

$$s_a^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$$

## Types of Sampling

- Simple Random Sampling:
In short, a lottery. Equal chance of for each datum from the populaiton to be part of the sample.

- Stratified Sampling:
Stratification is the act of forming groups. With stratified sampling, you take one sample from eveyr group formed. For example, a sports study may take one player from each team.

- Cluster Sampling: 
Take a simple random sample from each group naturally formed in a population, and then either examine everything in each cluster (one-stage cluster sampling) or take a second simple random sample (two-stage cluster sampling).

- Judgemental Sampling:
Pick a sample based on your best judgemnt.

- Accessibility Sampling:
Most easily obtained sample is taken.

- Quota Sampling: 
Combination of two previous methods. A quota of what the sample criteria should be is chosen, and than the most easily obtained sample is taken.
